This is my home on the web. Whenever I get the chance, I'll tinker and change things around a bit as an experiment or just when I get the itch to redesign again (which is, like, every couple months). 

## What I'm using:
**Jan 2014**
- **[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)**: I've been considering WordPress for the longest time, but it still seems like overkill for what I'm doing. I'm flirting with the idea of a blog at some point, but I think Jekyll will still be just fine.
- **Grunt/Gulp**: As soon as I finally get the hang of [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com), I find [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). So I'm currently in the middle of a redesign of the site, a migration to Gulp, and a migration to Jekyll. Why can't I just do one thing at a time? When I get things set up later, I'll detail my gulpfile.
- **[libsass](http://libsass.org/)**: This project isn't large by any stretch, so it's not like regular old Ruby Sass is slowing me down at all, but libsass is crazy fast and it's hard to say no to that.
- **[Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/)**: I tend to include frameworks and then not use them. We'll see how long this one lasts.
